#GroupProject1 Readme
#We started off our group project with the intent of investigating the relationship between clean energy ETF data and metal futures. through our data collection phase, we found it difficult to find reliable and usable sources for this investigating.

#We decided to pivot to real estate data and census data. 

#My role in this project was to collect data on rents in states that we selected. through looking at zillow and FRED, I found that FRED offers the best data.

#I started working on my rentalvacancy
#I started with merging my CSV files into one panda dataframe, and encoding them.

#Once I had this data, I cleaned it up to be inline with the years of census data we had

#I started by changing the data type of the cell values, and tranposing the graph so the states are the index

#I had to fix the column names because they were intergers, this took me ages to figure out why they were not working when I wanted to rename them later in this worksheet.
#I used google and old class slides to find the soluton

#I then plotted all the states on a line graph to see the data, which lead me to analyse the percentage change over the years.

#I stored the varibles to use them later 

#next I started with population vs rental analysis 

#I knew I wanted to look at the relationship of population change and rental vacancy on one graph

#I pulled stored variables from team members and my jupyter notebooks 

#Using this I merged them together, cleaned the data and plotted the bar graphs
#I used google to help me figure out how to make sure the bars are no overlapping
